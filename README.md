Project Summary and Problem Solved

For this course, I selected two project artifacts that best represent my skills: the ThermoLab project and the GPIO/UART communication lab. The ThermoLab project focused on reading environmental data from a temperature sensor and managing system behavior based on timed and state-based logic. The GPIO and UART lab demonstrated low-level hardware communication by transmitting and receiving data between the Raspberry Pi and external components. Together, these projects solved the problem of reliable hardware interaction, data handling, and communication in embedded systems.

What I Did Particularly Well

I successfully implemented clear state-based logic in the ThermoLab project to manage sensor readings, timing intervals, and output behavior. In the GPIO and UART lab, I demonstrated strong understanding of pin configuration, serial communication setup, and data transmission reliability. Across both projects, I maintained consistent structure and separation of concerns, which made testing and debugging more efficient.

Where I Could Improve

One area for improvement would be expanding fault tolerance and error handling. For example, adding validation for unexpected sensor values in ThermoLab or implementing retry logic for UART communication failures would improve reliability. I could also enhance documentation by including more detailed comments explaining communication timing and data flow.

Tools and Resources Added to My Support Network

These projects added several important tools and resources to my support network, including GPIO pin mapping references, UART protocol documentation, Raspberry Pi hardware manuals, and Linux-based debugging tools. Learning to use serial monitors and command-line utilities strengthened my ability to diagnose both hardware and communication issues.

Transferable Skills Gained

The skills gained from these projects are highly transferable to other coursework and professional projects. These include hardware-software integration, state machine design, sensor data processing, serial communication using UART, and embedded system debugging. These skills apply directly to IoT systems, real-time applications, and performance-sensitive environments.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

Both projects were designed with maintainability and readability in mind. I used descriptive variable names, consistent formatting, and modular code organization. The structure allows for easy adaptation, such as adding additional sensors to ThermoLab or extending UART communication to support different data formats or devices. This design approach ensures the codebase can evolve without significant refactoring.
